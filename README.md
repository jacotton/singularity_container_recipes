# container recipes

[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) container recipes for various bioinformatics and other tools. Some by me and others found in various open-source places. Hopefully the borrowed ones all have 'maintainer' flags - apologies if not. I'll try and go through and add links to where I found them. Very much a beginner at this, so these are barebones, but at least build and work for me.
